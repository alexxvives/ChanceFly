## ✅ Image Upload Implementation Summary

### **What I've Implemented:**

**1. 🏗️ Backend Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Created `/api/upload/aircraft-image` endpoint using **multer**
- ✅ Added static file serving at `/uploads/aircraft/`
- ✅ Added `aircraft_image_url` column to flights table
- ✅ Updated flight creation to store image URLs
- ✅ Updated flight retrieval to include image URLs

**2. 📱 Frontend Integration:**
- ✅ Modified CreateFlightPage to upload images before creating flights
- ✅ Updated FlightCard to display uploaded images
- ✅ Added fallback to default images if upload fails

**3. 🗄️ Database Schema:**
```sql
-- New column added to flights table
ALTER TABLE flights ADD COLUMN aircraft_image_url TEXT;
```

### **How It Works Now:**

**1. User Upload Flow:**
```
User selects image → Upload to /api/upload/aircraft-image → Get URL → Create flight with URL
```

**2. Display Flow:**
```
Flight API returns aircraft_image_url → FlightCard displays image → Fallback if image fails
```

### **Common Practices Implemented:**

**✅ Local File Storage (Current)**
- Files stored in `backend/uploads/aircraft/`
- URLs stored in database
- Good for development/small scale

**🚀 Ready for Cloud Upgrade:**
- Easy to switch to AWS S3/Cloudinary later
- Just change upload endpoint destination
- Database schema stays the same

### **File Handling Features:**
- ✅ **5MB file size limit**
- ✅ **Image type validation** (only images allowed)
- ✅ **Unique filenames** (timestamp + random)
- ✅ **Authentication required**
- ✅ **Error handling** with fallbacks

### **Next Steps:**
1. Test the upload flow
2. Verify images show in flight listings
3. Optional: Add image compression/resizing
4. Optional: Upgrade to cloud storage when scaling

**Your images should now persist and display correctly in flight listings!** 🎉
